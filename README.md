Daylight_Savings_Time_Example
=============================

I've had a few projects ([Wimp Weather Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-station-wirelessly-connected-to-wunderground), [GPS Clock](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/47), etc) that needed local time corrected with daylight savings.
 
This examples uses current date, UTC time and local offset to generate the correct local time.
